**Description**

Everything has a beginning and web apps are no different. Learn how today's web applications came out of the primordial soup that was frames and flash and evolved to the modern apps of today. We'll go over these historical transitions and also learn from the mistakes of the past. After all, those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
